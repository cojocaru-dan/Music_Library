# Music Library Project
## In this project, we create a console application to manage a music library. The application should include the following features:
### •	Add Songs: Allow the user to add songs to the library. The user should be prompted to enter the name of the song, the artist, and the duration of the song in seconds.
### •	View Library: Allow the user to view the current library of songs. The list should be displayed in alphabetical order by artist name.
### •	Search Songs: Allow the user to search for songs by artist name. The user should be prompted to enter the name of the artist, and the application should display a list of all songs by that artist.
### •	Remove Song: Allow the user to remove a song from the library. The user should be prompted to enter the name of the song to remove.
### •	Clear Library: Allow the user to clear the entire library of songs.

## We have a list with 30 random songs. We use these to initialize our library.

## our application should:
### •	satisfy the Single Responsibility Principle
### •	use the Interface Segregation Principle
### •	use Dependency Injection
### •	include logging of the operations
### •	follow Clean Code Principles
